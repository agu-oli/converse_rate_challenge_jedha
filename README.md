# converse_rate_challenge_jedha

## This is a deliverable of the Jedha's Data Science and Engineering bootcamp module on Supervised Machine Learning

### In this notebook we have implemented a logistic regression model for a binary classification problem
#### The dataset gathers data about users activity in a website
#### The dataset source is kaggle
#### The model predicts whether the user will suscribe to the newsletter or not

### Dataset issues
#### The dataset target variable is not balanced. This has consequences on the model performances

#### Different methods and models are applied for improved the result of the baseline model, whose accuracy seeems good enough but the whose performance must be reconsidered when we calculate the f1-score.

### The model predictions on new data are included in the file dataset_test_with_predictions.csv with the corresponding dataset
